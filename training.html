            <h2>Where to start?</h2>
            <p>
              You should start with small bits of training with your new puppy
              right away, but remember, you can train your dog at any age, even
              older dogs can benefit from training. It’s likely you want to
              start with the fundamentals, the most important things you can
              teach your dog are in this category. These basics include potty
              training, come (recall), sit, and stay. I cover those in more
              detail below.
            </p>
            <p>
              With new puppies the primary thing you should focus on is building
              trust but take advantage of training opportunities at the same
              time.
            </p>
            <ul class="extra-padding-y">
              <li>
                Try to keep an eye on the cues from your dog on their readiness
                to tackle a new challenge.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be consistent with your training and the rules, follow through
                every time.
              </li>
              <li>Positive reinforcement is more powerful than punishment.</li>
              <li>Play with your dog often to fortify trust and bonding.</li>
              <li>Be sure to nurture your dog’s trust in you.</li>
              <li>
                Keep training, bite-size treats on hand, always. Be generous
                with the treats but make sure your dog earns them!
              </li>
              <li>
                If your dog seems to be losing interest or is distracted, that
                may be a sign to take a break and come back to the session
                later.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be patient with your dog, avoid getting frustrated and angry,
                it’s detrimental to focus that anger or frustration at your dog.
              </li>

                  We should start this segment with a disclaimer: There will be
                  accidents, if you have carpet your puppy will soil it. Along
                  with all the other supplies you need, pick up some sort of
                  carpet cleaner, and test it on a small section of your carpet
                  that will go unnoticed. Don’t be caught unprepared here. An
                  old belief with handling accidents to yell at them or rub
                  their nose in it, which should not be practiced as this
                  damages trust and is likely to create other problems.
                  Expressing disapproval in a healthy way is okay, a stern ‘no’
                  is appropriate on the spot, but not when you find the mess
                  later. If you catch them in the middle of conducting their
                  business indoors take them outside immediately to demonstrate
                  where it’s okay. Positive reinforcement is a lot more powerful
                  here, rewarding your puppy every time they relieve themselves
                  in the proper place, and over time they’ll have fewer
                  accidents. Be patient, this process can be frustrating and
                  even take months, but done properly you will see progress.

                <h3 id="routine">Routine</h3>
                <p>
                  Routine is very key to potty training your puppy. You might
                  start to notice a pattern with the timing of accidents you
                  find in the house, especially in relation to when they eat.
                  For this reason, mealtime should happen on a consistent
                  schedule. Your puppy might also drop hints when they need to
                  do their business and is likely to favor the same indoor spots
                  to have their accidents. Try to take your puppy out
                  frequently, especially first thing in the morning, last thing
                  at night, and after every meal. Very young puppies might need
                  to go in the middle of the night, expect disruption to your
                  sleep for the first couple months as an investment to long
                  term success with potty training.

            <p>
              Kennel training is covered in more depth
              <a href="/new-puppies.html#crate-training">here</a> and is key to
              the potty training effort. Be sure to check out that section about
              kennel training before introducing your dog to their crate. Dogs
              will avoid soiling the place they sleep as they become more
              accustomed to their kennel. A rule of thumb is to limit their stay
              in the kennel to one hour for every month of age. For example, a
              two-month-old puppy should spend no longer than 2 hours in the
              kennel, a three-month-old puppy is 3 hours. The top limit is about
              five to six hours for older pups but it’s highly discouraged to
              keep any poor dog kenneled for that long if it can be avoided. If
              you work during the day arrange to have someone come and let your
              pup out once or twice while you’re away.

                <p>
                  I talk more about controlled environments
                  <a href="/new-puppies.html#boundaries">here</a>, but this is
                  very important to minimizing accidents and keeping an eye on
                  your pup at all times. Constant supervision is required for
                  your young puppy and if you can’t watch him/her ask someone
                  else to keep an eye on them while you’re busy. A short stay in
                  the kennel is acceptable, or, if you have one, a puppy playpen
                  is great too. Your young puppy should not be allowed to wander
                  the house, I recommend baby gates and closing doors. Dogs will
                  favor somewhere out of your view to have their accidents,
                  eliminate this risk by blocking access to these areas.
                  Alternatively, you could use a leash and harness to keep your
                  pup close to you, even in the house. This is a great
                  opportunity to introduce leash training and keep your dog
                  close to you. I don’t have any content on leash training but I
                  recommend Zak George’s training videos, you’ll find them all
                  over my site.

                <p>
                  Training your dog to come when called, otherwise known as
                  recall, is one of the most important things you can teach your
                  dog. This isn’t only important for having a dog who listens to
                  you and stays out of trouble but also for their own safety.
                  The sooner you can start training your dog recall, the better.
                  It’s important to consistently reward them when they come, no
                  matter how long it takes. The need for rewarding can be eased
                  after a while but it’s very important to condition the belief
                  that if they come when they are called good things always
                  happen. For this same reason, you should never call your dog
                  to come to you for punishment. Early on, set aside time to
                  have training sessions to introduce the ‘come’ command and
                  reward liberally. Take baby steps and ease the difficulty
                  slowly over time. Take a break if your pup starts losing
                  interest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Distractions can derail your dog’s attention and create a
                  frustrating experience for you when your dog doesn’t listen.
                  Early on, start in a small space with minimal distraction. Of
                  course, this doesn’t prepare your dog for the real world, but
                  when you’re starting out you want to start small and increase
                  the difficulty from there. Many dog trainers use leashes
                  indoors to make sure their pups stay close and are always
                  accessible, for their own safety. Pups love to crawl under
                  beds and behind furniture, they may not want to come out when
                  called. I don’t recommend using the leash to pull your dog to
                  motivate them to come when called unless you’re pulling them
                  out of somewhere they shouldn’t be. Let them learn and ease
                  them into it by making it easy at first. Eventually, your dog
                  will want to come to you when you ask them to.

            <p>
              Get your puppy excited to come to you! This helps keep them
              engaged and gives you both some enjoyment for any training
              session. Use a higher-pitched and inviting tone to motivate them
              to listen and let them know how good they’re doing. Especially
              with puppies, but also with older dogs, get on your feet, lead
              them to chase you, incorporate some fun movement. Toys, especially
              squeaky ones, are awesome at getting your dog’s attention and
              adding some enjoyment to the training session. Note that,
              sometimes, you may need to get down on the floor or crouch down a
              bit, it helps to get on their level and let them see your face.

              It goes without saying that treats are important to any training
              effort, make sure it’s a treat that your pup loves. Try to keep
              the treats on you or nearby, countless training opportunities will
              present themself throughout the day and only take a second to take
              advantage of. As previously mentioned, toys and a leash are great
              tools to make this easier but don’t pull the leash when they
              aren’t listening if it’s not necessary. Dogs also respond well to
              nonverbal cues or gestures such as pointing your dog to where you
              want them to be. Some trainers like to use clickers as an
              indication to a dog that they like a specific behavior. With the
              ‘come’ command I found finger-snapping to be something my dogs
              respond well to and a great indicator of where I want them to come
              to.

                  It’s not reasonable to expect your dog to understand what they
                  should do when you command a sit, you’ll need to start slow
                  and level up the difficulty at a slow and gradual pace. An
                  easy win is to get your puppy's attention on a treat and ease
                  them into a sit by, very, very slowly, lifting the treat above
                  their head. A natural tendency here is for your dog to sit so
                  they stabilize themselves to look up and try and get the
                  treat. Your pup might try standing on two feet to get a higher
                  stance, this is the opposite of what you want. Keep working on
                  it, release the treat as soon as their butt hits the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A hand gesture is very helpful here too, just the simple act
                  of lifting up the treat helps make the request easier to
                  understand in the early stages of teaching your dog to sit. I
                  use a gesture of holding out my hand and bending my wrist back
                  as the visual cue for my dog to sit down. Over time you can
                  start to phase the gesture so your dog starts responding to
                  the verbal command alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that, at this point, we haven’t introduced the sit
                  command just yet. It’s okay to repeat the word sit in order to
                  build that association with the command and the action, but
                  don’t expect an immediate response early on. Once your dog
                  starts catching on that they get a treat each time they sit
                  they’ll do it without prompt, and this is okay. Reward
                  liberally early on and start increasing the difficulty. With
                  time and patience, your canine will plop their bottom down
                  when you ask them too.

            <h3 id="paying-attention">Paying Attention</h3>
            <p>
              A challenge you’ll notice any dog is their tendency to become
              distracted and stop paying attention to you. This can derail any
              training session, so it’s important we start out in a quiet
              environment. It’s worth investing time in getting your dog to
              simply acknowledge their name. A training exercise of its own is
              to reward your dog to look up at you when you say their name.
              Getting them to watch your hands is good too, which they’ll do
              anyway because they are interested in the treat you’re holding.
              This is a great opportunity to use gestures, which your pup might
              more easily notice.
            </p>
            <h3 id="long-term">Long Term</h3>
            <p>
              The sit command is easy to reinforce over time. Don’t expect your
              pup to understand what they should do in your second and third
              training sessions even if they had it down the time before. It
              takes practice to build a habit. You may have to ask them multiple
              times early on, don’t be discouraged. Keep treats on hand and give
              them a surprise request to sit outside of a training session and
              in a more distracting environment. Eventually, you can ease off
              the liberal reward but give it a long while before you start doing
              so. You may be tempted to ease the frequency of rewards when your
              dog starts becoming pretty dependable with any given behavior, but
              this may invite regression in the progress you and your pup have
              made in any area of training.

            <h3 id="stay-foundations">Foundations</h3>
            <p>
              The stay command is a natural transition from sit, they’re already
              halfway there if they’ve got this down. Reward liberally early on,
              it’s difficult for a puppy to hold still and to understand you
              want them to stay put. Adding the additional challenge of making
              them wait for the treat while sitting, when they’re ready, makes
              adding stay an easy command to introduce. Be careful about
              expecting your pup to stay for too long, too early. Very gradually
              start adding time, it’s very easy to tell when you’ve asked for
              too much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let your pup know when the ‘stay’ is over, invite them to come to
              get the treat or hand it over. Patience and encouragement are key,
              just like with any other training exercise. I find a gesture to be
              helpful here, my chosen gesture is to point at my dog while saying
              stay. Eventually, if you wish, you can phase out the gesture but
              it’s great to use when your puppy isn’t getting it with the verbal
              cue alone.
            </p>
            <h3 id="distractions">Distractions</h3>
            <p>
              Of course, early on, you’ll want to start in a quiet area where
              your pup is more likely to continue paying attention to you. This
              isn’t always a realistic scenario so as you become more confident
              in your dog start introducing some distractions. Puppies are
              easily distracted by movement, especially if it’s quick. If you
              threw a treat your dog is likely to chase it. Make it easy at
              first, move the treat slowly in front of them, then let them have
              it. You can start increasing the speed and distance of this
              movement over time. Try setting the treat down for a split second,
              then leave that little temptation out for a bit longer over
              several iterations.
