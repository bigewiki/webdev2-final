            <h2>Puppies are a challenge</h2>
            <p>
              It’s a great idea to be prepared for your new furry family member
              to come home. Here are some of the basic supplies you might want
              to get before or immediately after bringing in your pup.
            </p>
            <h3>Puppy Food</h3>
            <p>
              If possible, find out what brand of food your puppy was eating
              before you take them home. In our case, we were given a small bag
              of food to take along with our pup. Assuming you aren’t sticking
              with whatever kind of food your pup was eating before you’ll want
              to research some puppy food brands and varieties. You may not
              stick with the new food for a while but it’s ideal if you do. All
              dogs need to be gradually transitioned to a new kind of food over
              time. This conversion should take about a week but a more steady
              transition is preferred, over the course of two weeks. Every day
              increase the proportion of new food in your dog’s bowl, a ten
              percent incremental increase is reasonable here.
            </p>
            <h3>Treats</h3>
            <p>
              When you start training it’s necessary to have treats on hand. I
              recommend using the tiny training treats, your pup will love them!
              There are alternatives to treats for training, even kibbles of
              puppy food are acceptable, but being prepared with treats lets you
              take advantage of more training opportunities with your pup.
            </p>
            <h3>Bowls</h3>
            <p>
              Among the must-haves are bowls, one for water and one for food, of
              course. No need to go overboard with the supplies, you could
              simply borrow an old dish or Tupperware for the short term. Avoid
              anything breakable, such as ceramic or glass.
            </p>
            <h3>Toys</h3>
            <p>
              You’ll want to have a few different kinds of toys to captivate
              your puppy’s attention. Pup’s love to tear apart the softer,
              plushier toys. This doesn’t mean you should avoid them, just be
              wary of whatever’s stuffed inside: your pup may want to eat the
              stuffing or that stuffing may end up all over the place. Have
              tougher toys on hand, anything that can take a lot of punishment
              will last a long time, especially as your puppy starts teething.
              Ropes are great for playing tug-of-war with your dog, a beloved
              canine pastime. Toys that engage your dog’s mind, such as puzzle
              toys, are awesome too. Do your research here and be mindful of
              what’s appropriate for your dog’s age and size.
            </p>
            <h3>Crate, Playpen, and Baby Gates</h3>
            <p>
              I’ll cover the value of these items in greater details in the
              (((BOUNDARIES LINK))) section below. These could be the most
              expensive of the pet supplies you need. I recommend having, at the
              very least, a kennel for your pup. You may need to upgrade the
              size over time but most new kennels come with an extra partition
              you can use to section off part of the kennel, which you can
              remove as your pup grows into it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Baby gates range in price and quality. There may not be much
              reason in spending too much money on this as it’s only really
              needed for the short term unless you have an infant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Puppy playpens are great for when you want to give your canine a
              bit more space but can’t keep a vigilant watch over them while
              you’re busy. When shopping for a puppy playpen be mindful of your
              pup’s size, breed, and how quickly they’ll grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              All these items are great to find second hand at a discount, just
              be sure to properly clean and disinfect for the health and safety
              of you and your puppy.
            </p>
            <h3>Bed and Blankets</h3>
            <p>
              Dogs love having somewhere soft to rest, this could end up being
              your bed or sofa. As dog moms and dads all observe different
              policies when it comes to our dogs and our furniture, while your
              pup is still being potty trained you may want to discuss and come
              to a family agreement on what this policy is. Regardless, every
              dog should have a bed of some sort, for those on a budget an old
              blanket will do great. You may not want to invest too much money
              on a dog bed as your pup is likely to chew on it. It’s only
              natural and should be expected.
            </p>
            <h3>Collar, Harness, and Leash</h3>
            <p>
              Every domestic dog should, of course, have a collar. This may not
              be an immediate necessity but it provides a bit of peace of mind
              when you’ve attached a dog tag that helps him or her find their
              way home if they manage to escape. Even for puppies who are too
              young to leave the house, having a leash and harness can be great
              for training and maintaining control of your puppy and their
              environment. It’s not a bad idea to introduce a leash and harness
              to your pup early to foster familiarity with the concept and make
              leash training on walks easier in the future. I cover this a bit
              more in the (((BOUNDARIES LINK))) section below.
            </p>
            <h3>Other Supplies</h3>
            <p>
              Your puppy is likely to need a bath every so often, be sure to
              pick up a safe and appropriate shampoo. Do yourself a favor and be
              prepared with something to clean pet messes from carpets and
              floors. Oral hygiene is too often neglected, your dog should have
              regular teeth cleanings. It’s a good idea to have the supplies for
              brushing your canine’s teeth and making this a regular ritual. I
              won’t go into detail here but I encourage you to do some research
              into doggy oral health and become better informed on the topic.
            </p>
            <h3>Life Hacks</h3>
            <p>
              There’s a ton of ways to save money on pet supplies. Consider
              getting some of these items second hand, other household’s pets
              frequently outgrow or no longer need some of the things you may
              need for your puppy. Also, you could check out some other clever
              solutions other pet owners have come up with, check out this
              video, and hit Google, Pinterest, YouTube, etcetera, for more
              ideas.

                  Your puppy will need several shots and vaccinations during
                  their first months, years, and regularly throughout their
                  lifetime. Always consult your vet on what your pup needs to be
                  happy and healthy. Your vet should recommend keeping your dog
                  home while they’re very young to avoid microbial threats to
                  their wellbeing. Check out this guide from the American Kennel

                  Consider spaying or neutering your dog when they’re old
                  enough. I recommend doing some research on the subject if
                  you’re on the fence. There are valid benefits to consider for
                  the health, safety, and behavior of your dog.
