              <p>
                Hello! Thank you for visiting the site. The picture here has our
                two dogs, Jazzy and Penny. They're both mutts, we can only
                speculate to their breeds, not that it matters much. They’re
                both quirky and sweet in their own regard. Jasmine is the one
                with the brindle coat, the older of the two at only three years
                old. She loves to bark at shadows and go on w-a-l-k’s (you can’t
                say the word out loud or she’ll get very excited). Penny, the
                other with the black coat, is the puppy at only 5 months old.
                She’s a bundle of boundless energy who loves to run, jump, dig,
                and relieve anything stuffed of its inner fluff. The dog bed
                pictured has since met its brutal end in a scene of fluffy
                carnage.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to dog training, I’m no professional. I’ve made
                mistakes and have got a lot of work to do. When I originally
                chose this topic for my website Penny was a brand new addition
                to our household. I was watching training videos frequently and
                doing my best to stay consistent. It’s a challenge a lot of the
                time but I expect the work and effort to pay off in the long run
                with a well mannered and behaved dog.
              </p>
              <p>
                This website will act as a conduit for everything I’ve learned
                over the past few months in my endeavors with the basics puppy
                training. Putting all this together helps solidify the
                information and brings me back to the basics, which still need
                some work. Hopefully this helps you too.
