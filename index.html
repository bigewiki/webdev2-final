        <h2>New Puppies</h2>
        <p>
          The thought of adding a new furry addition to the family can be both
          exciting and daunting. We're often unprepared as new pet owners, even
          if we've done it. Start here if you've gotten a new puppy or plan on
          getting one.

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>
          Training your puppy is important, not only to have a well-behaved dog,
          but for their own safety and everyone’s sanity. There’s a handful of
          basics every dog should know and all new puppies owners should take
          the time to work on some fundamentals with their family member.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Learn about me and my family! I'm not a professional trainer but
          wanted to pass on what I've learned during my struggle to train our
          new puppy. It hasn’t been easy and we’ve had to adapt to our newest
          family member with boundless energy.
